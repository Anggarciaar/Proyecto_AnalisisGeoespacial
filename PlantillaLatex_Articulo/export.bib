   abstract = {Many researchers are currently seeking conventional geological sequestrations for carbon dioxide (CO2) storage, including saline aquifers, depleted conventional hydrocarbon reservoirs, and unminable coal seams. Only a few researchers have looked into depleted-shale formations for possible CO2 sequestration because of safety and economic reasons. To improve this situation, many measures should be taken. First and foremost, it is of great significance to find a method to estimate the CO2-storage capacity in depleted shale. In this paper, a new analytical method to estimate CO2-storage capacity in shale was developed. First, a trilinear-flow model proposed for the depleted-shale reservoir had a horizontal injection well-namely, a multiple-fractured horizontal well (MFHW)-at a constant injection rate. The model incorporated multiple mechanisms such as Knudson diffusion, gas adsorption, and effect of stress sensitivity. Then, the transient-pressure solution of the injection well was solved by applying mathematical methods of the Pedrosa (1986) substitution and Laplace transform. Subsequently, CO2-storage capacity was evaluated according to the transient-pressure performance of the injection well. After that, model verification and sensitivity analysis were conducted. Finally, we applied the proposed method in a case derived from the New Albany Shale, which had been proved to be a promising candidate for CO2 storage. The results show that good agreements exist between our analytical results and these numerical solutions. The average difference is approximately 3.03%, which shows our methodology is reasonable. Further, it only takes approximately 10 seconds of central-processing-unit (CPU) time with 100 timesteps by use of the proposed approach to estimate the CO2-storage capacity of the study area in the New Albany Shale, which indicates the new approach is rapid. In addition, results of sensitive analysis show that as stress-sensitivity coefficient, adsorption index, and Knudsen diffusion coefficient increase, CO2-storage capacity increases. As storage ratio increases, CO2-storage capacity decreases. This work provides a new approach to the estimation of CO2-storage capacity, which is beneficial to exploit the residual depleted-shale reservoirs as well as decrease CO2 emissions.},

   abstract = {In this paper, based on pressure transient analysis (PTA), a quick and reasonable analytical method for estimating CO2 storage capacity of depleted shales is introduced. Firstly, a CO2 seepage model for an injection well with constant injection rate is proposed in consideration of Knudsen diffusion, gas adsorption, and stress-sensitivity effect of permeability. Then, combined with Laplace transform and Pedrosa's substitution, the seepage model is solved and the transient pressure solutions of the injection well are obtained. At last, with these solutions, CO2 storage capacity can be easily estimated at an arbitrary injection pressure. To verify the proposed approach, a derived case from the New Albany Shale is studied. Furthermore, on the basis of the case, the influences of some critical parameters on CO2 storage capacity are analyzed. The research results demonstrate that there is a good agreement between the proposed method and the numerical method, with the maximum difference smaller than 1.5%. In addition, sensitive analysis shows that CO2 storage capacity increases with the increasing of stress-sensitivity coefficient, adsorption index, Knudsen diffusion coefficient and constrained injection pressure; it decreases with the increasing of storage ratio. It is also found that as constrained injection pressure increases, the effects of the parameters above on the storage capacity become more obvious.},

   abstract = {This paper reports on research sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy (USDOE) to assess factors influencing enhanced gas recovery (EGR) and CO2 storage in selected gas shales in the Eastern USA [1]. The paper also summarizes work sponsored by the IEA Greenhouse Gas R&D Programme (IEAGHG), which builds upon the lessons learned regarding EGR and CO2 storage in the U.S., combined with a global assessment of shale gas potential [2], to develop a high-level estimate of the potential for EGR and CO2 storage in gas shales globally [3]. In total, the four selected shale gas plays in the Eastern USA addressed in this assessment cover an area of 470,000 square kilometres (182,000 square miles). These shales may contain an estimated 170 trillion cubic meters (Tcm) (6,000 trillion cubic feet (Tcf)) of gas in place, and have a maximum theoretical storage capacity of over 600 billion metric tons (gigatonnes, Gt). Accounting for assumptions about the portion of the gas in-place in these shale plays that may be recoverable, and the portion of this recoverable resource that could be economic to produce using EGR techniques with CO2 injection, nearly 34 Tcm (1,200 Tcf) of EGR potential is estimated to be associated with the injection of CO2 into these shale gas plays. Of this, 13 Tcm (460 Tcf) could be economic to recover with reasonable gas prices and/or modest incentives. This could facilitate the storage of nearly 50 Gt of CO2. Building upon this work, as well as an assessment by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (USEIA) that provides a "firstorder" view of the gas in-place and technically recoverable resource for 48 shale gas basins and 69 shale gas formations in 32 countries, an estimate was developed of the global the potential for EGR and CO2 storage in gas shales [3]. An estimated 188 Tcm (6,600 Tcf) of shale gas resources are potentially technically recoverable globally (not including consideration of the potential EGR realized as a result of CO2 injection in shales). This could facilitate the potential storage of 740 Gt of CO2 in gas shales. Of this, as much as 71 Tcm (2,505 Tcf) could be economic to produce with EGR, and could facilitate the economic storage of 280 Gt of CO2.},

   abstract = {Options for the geologic storage of carbon dioxide vary from saline aquifers and depleted oil and gas reservoirs to unminable coal seams and abandoned coal mines. Important aspects include the sealing integrity of the cap rock and potential changes in this integrity, owing to the interaction with CO2. In this study, diffusive transport and gas sorption experiments on one well characterised shale sample (Muderong Shale, Australia) and different clay minerals were performed to obtain information on the sealing integrity and the CO2 storage potential of these materials. All measurements were performed under reservoir conditions relevant for CO2 storage (T = 45-50 °C; p < 20 MPa). Repeat diffusion experiments on one shale plug yielded increased effective diffusion coefficients and a decrease in the concentration of the bulk CO2 volume in the sample. The latter is believed to be dissolved in formation water, sorbed to mineral surfaces or involved with geochemical reactions. For the Muderong Shale, bulk volume CO2 concentrations are greater within the experimental time frame (222-389 mol/m3), when compared to coal and cemented sandstone (3-4 and 8-10 mol/m3), respectively. This high CO2 storage potential could not fully be explained by CO2 dissolution in water alone. Thus, gas sorption experiments were performed on crushed shale and various clay minerals. High CO2 sorption capacities (e.g. up to 1 mmol/g for the Muderong Shale) show that the high CO2 concentration is related to a combination of CO2 dissolution in water and gas sorption on clay minerals. Additionally, changes in specific surface areas before and after the sorption experiments and variations in the CO2 sorption and diffusion behaviour due to repetitive experiments on the identical sample were observed, possibly related to geochemical alteration of the Muderong Shale and the clay minerals. These could not be quantified however and seemed to occur only at high pressures. Results obtained in this study provide a more positive view on the sealing integrity of intact cap rock formations. Carbon dioxide that migrates from a storage reservoir into the cap rock through the pore network will be immobilised to a certain extent, hence minimising (slow, diffusion-driven) leakage and providing additional CO2 storage potential. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {The morphology and evolution of diapirs and mud volcanoes in the Colombian Caribbean Margin (MCC) located in transgressive Cretaceous to Neogene sedimentary sequences are analyzed in this paper. They are extrusive structures by argilokinesis that show the release of overpressure and fluidized sediments by water and/or hydrocarbons that pierce the surface. From the analogical modeling of the determining factors of origin and geometry, the diapirism mechanisms depend on: i) the lower density of the underlying generating levels compared to the overlying sequences, and ii) the weak sedimentation rates of the overlayered sequences. The progressive exhumation of the Sinú-San Jacinto Belt from the Oligo-Miocene period due to the dextral transpressive tectonic convergence between the South American and Caribbean plates, generated a barrier to sedimentary transport to the North of the Paleo Cauca River. This interruption prevented its direct discharge, forcing it to coalesce into the Magdalena River, increasing the volume of its delta. A provincialism of diapirism is proposed based on the differences in rates and chronologies of the progradation of denser sediments on pelitic sequences associated with conspicuous types of folds: a) to the north (San Jacinto Belt), tangential compressional type with a double plunge, and oriented subparallel to the Caribbean coast, and b) to the south (Sinú Belt), gravitational type with wide synclines and tight anticlines. Better knowledge of the 4D evolution of MCC diapirism contributes to the potential of the underlying oil systems and the prevention of environmental risks in exploratory maneuvers.},

   abstract = {The merits of CO2 capture and storage to the environmental stability of our world should not be underestimated as emissions of greenhouse gases cause serious problems. It represents the only technology that might rid our atmosphere of the main anthropogenic gas while allowing for the continuous use of the fossil fuels which still power today’s world. Underground storage of CO2 involves the injection of CO2 into suitable geological formations and the monitoring of the injected plume over time, to ensure containment. Over the last two or three decades, attention has been paid to technology developments of carbon capture and sequestration. Therefore, it is high time to look at the research done so far. In this regard, a high-level review article is required to provide an overview of the status of carbon capture and sequestration research. This article presents a review of CO2 storage technologies which includes a background of essential concepts in storage, the physical processes involved, modeling procedures and simulators used, capacity estimation, measuring monitoring and verification techniques, risks and challenges involved and field-/pilot-scale projects. It is expected that the present review paper will help the researchers to gain a quick knowledge of CO2 sequestration for future research in this field.},
